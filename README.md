# Pre-Kirshor

A super simple text pre-processor focused on increasing
compression ratio of a text file before compression
with a standard compression algorithm.

This program has been written to publish the sci-fi
novel 'Upon the Mirror Sea' on the decentralized
Twitter at a price lower than $0.03 at the time of writing.

The Pre-Kirshor is named after Jessica Kirsh.
